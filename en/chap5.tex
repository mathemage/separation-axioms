\section{The $T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$ axiom}

\begin{framed}
  \begin{df}[$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$]
    A topological space $X$ is said to be \emph{completely regular\/} (or
    equally \emph{$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$-space\/}) if
    \begin{center} \it
      for any $x\in X$ and any closed $A$ such that $x\not\in A$ there is a
      continuous function $\phi\colon X \to \I$ with $\phi(x) = 0$ and $\phi[A]
      = \{1\}$.
    \end{center}
  \end{df}
\end{framed}

Analogously as in regular case:

\begin{framed}
  \begin{df}[CReg]
    A locale is called \emph{completely regular\/} if
    \[
      a = \bigvee \{x \st x \cb a\}
    \]
    for all its elements $a$.
  \end{df}
\end{framed}
